# {{project-name}}

> {{project_description}}

This is a minimal Cargo workspace. It starts with one dependency-free primary
crate and private repository automation; it does not assume a domain structure
for you.

## Develop

```sh
cargo xtask check
cargo xtask test
cargo xtask build
cargo xtask --help
```

## Grow the workspace

Use project-prefixed semantic crate names, inspired by uv's ownership model:

```sh
cargo xtask scaffold crate workspace
cargo xtask scaffold crate resolver
cargo xtask scaffold crate client --private
```

Those examples are illustrative. Choose a noun from your own domain; do not
copy uv's Python-specific crate names.

Avoid generic buckets such as `core`, `common`, `shared`, `utils`, and `misc`.
A CLI command or a Cargo feature is not automatically a crate either. Keep
behavior inside the primary crate first, then extract a crate when it owns a
coherent responsibility, gives callers a smaller interface than its
implementation, and improves locality for changes and tests.

Use `types` only for a shared vocabulary or trait that prevents a real
dependency cycle. Use `dispatch` only when multiple domain modules need a
dedicated orchestration module. One adapter is a hypothetical seam; introduce
an adapter seam when behavior actually varies.

An application can eventually grow toward this shape without pre-generating it:

```text
{{project-name}}                 # entry/composition package
├── {{project-name}}-cli         # command grammar and parsing
├── {{project-name}}-workspace   # workspace model
├── {{project-name}}-resolver    # domain behavior
└── {{project-name}}-client      # external adapter
```

The entry/composition package may depend on many product crates. Domain crates
must not depend on the entrypoint or CLI. When one product crate depends on
another, declare it once under root `[workspace.dependencies]` and use
`{ workspace = true }` from the member manifest. Dependencies used only by
`xtask` stay in `tools/xtask/Cargo.toml`.

## Add a CLI

```sh
# Keep a public library independent of Clap. This is the default.
cargo xtask scaffold cli --entrypoint companion

# Use the primary crate as an uv-like application composition package.
cargo xtask scaffold cli --entrypoint primary
```

Both modes create `{{project-name}}-cli` for the command model. The companion
mode owns the executable in that private package; the primary mode adds a thin
binary wrapper to the primary package and makes the CLI crate publishable.
Publish the CLI crate before the primary package when releasing to crates.io.

## More capabilities

```sh
cargo xtask scaffold ci
cargo xtask scaffold docs
cargo xtask scaffold agents --claude
cargo xtask scaffold crate <semantic-name> --dry-run
```

Scaffolds are explicit, idempotent, and refuse to overwrite unmarked
user-owned files. Generated projects are snapshots: template updates are not
applied automatically.
